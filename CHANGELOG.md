## [2.2.4] - 2026-03-24

### 🔧 Enhancement Release

**Third-party security product detection for ASR module and verification.**

### ✨ Added

**EDR/XDR and Third-Party AV Detection ([#15](https://github.com/NexusOne23/noid-privacy/issues/15))**
- New: 3-layer detection for third-party security products:
  - Layer 1: WMI `SecurityCenter2` (traditional AV: Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Avira, Norton, ESET, etc.)
  - Layer 2: Defender Passive Mode via `Get-MpComputerStatus` (EDR/XDR: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, etc.)
  - Layer 3: 18 known EDR service names for display identification
- New: `Test-ThirdPartySecurityProduct` function in `Utils/Dependencies.ps1` (central, reusable)
- New: `Test-WindowsDefenderAvailable` now reports `IsPassiveMode` property
- ASR module gracefully skips when third-party product detected (`Success = $true`, not an error)
- Verify script counts ASR as 19/19 verified when third-party product is primary
- Reported by: VM-Master

**Version Management**
- New: `VERSION` file as single source of truth for version numbers
- New: `Tools/Bump-Version.ps1` — automated version bump across all 61 project files
  - DryRun mode for preview, CHANGELOG.md excluded (historical entries preserved)

### 📁 Files Changed
- `Utils/Dependencies.ps1` — New `Test-ThirdPartySecurityProduct`, updated `Test-WindowsDefenderAvailable`, updated `Test-AllDependencies`
- `Modules/ASR/Public/Invoke-ASRRules.ps1` — 3-layer detection before Defender check, inline fallback for standalone mode
- `Tools/Verify-Complete-Hardening.ps1` — 3-layer detection, ASR verified as skipped when third-party product active
- `Tools/Bump-Version.ps1` — New file
- `VERSION` — New file

## [2.2.3] - 2026-03-05

### 🔨 Bugfix Release

**Restore Mode crash fix and Recall snapshot storage verification fix.**

### 🔨 Fixed

**Restore Mode Module Selection Crash (Critical)**
- Fixed: Selecting `[M] Restore only SELECTED modules` and entering any module number caused a fatal PowerShell error
- Root cause: `.Split(',', ';', ' ')` triggered wrong .NET overload `Split(string, Int32)`, interpreting `;` as count parameter
- Fix: Replaced with native PowerShell `-split '[,; ]'` operator
- Impact: Manual module selection in Restore workflow now works correctly
- Reported by: KatCat2

**Recall Snapshot Storage Verification (Bug)**
- Fixed: "Maximum snapshot storage: 10 GB" verification always reported as failed
- Root cause: Microsoft's WindowsAI CSP stores snapshot storage in **MB**, not GB (e.g., `10240` = 10 GB)
- Fix: Updated expected values in config, apply, verify, and docs to use MB values
- Affected values: 10→10240, 25→25600, 50→51200, 75→76800, 100→102400, 150→153600, 0=OS default unchanged
- Reported by: VM-Master ([#14](https://github.com/NexusOne23/noid-privacy/issues/14))

## [2.2.2] - 2025-12-22

### 🚀 Performance Release

**Major performance improvement for AdvancedSecurity firewall operations.**

### ⚡ Performance

**Firewall Snapshot Performance Fix (Critical)**
- Fixed: Firewall rules backup took 60-120 seconds (especially in offline mode)
- Root cause: `Get-NetFirewallPortFilter` was called individually for each of ~300+ firewall rules (~200ms per call)
- Fix: Batch query approach - load all port filters once into hashtable, then fast lookup by InstanceID
- Result: **60-120 seconds → 2-5 seconds** (both online and offline)
- Affected files:
  - `Modules/AdvancedSecurity/Private/Backup-AdvancedSecuritySettings.ps1`
  - `Modules/AdvancedSecurity/Private/Disable-RiskyPorts.ps1`

### ✅ Changed

**Version Alignment**
- All 60+ framework files updated to v2.2.2
- Module manifests (.psd1), module loaders (.psm1), core scripts, utilities, tests, and documentation synchronized

---

## [2.2.1] - 2025-12-19

### 🔧 Maintenance Release

**Critical bugfix for multi-run sessions and code review.**

### 🔨 Fixed

**Multi-Run Session Bug (Critical)**
- Fixed: Running framework multiple times in same PowerShell session caused `auditpol.exe` backup failures
- Root cause: `$global:BackupBasePath` was not reset between runs, causing auditpol to fail with "file exists" error
- Fix: Global backup variables (`BackupBasePath`, `BackupIndex`, `NewlyCreatedKeys`, `SessionManifest`, `CurrentModule`) are now reset at script start in `NoIDPrivacy.ps1`
- Impact: Users can now run individual modules, then "Apply All", then individual modules again without errors

**`.Count` Property Bug (5 files)**
- Fixed: `.Count` property failed on single-object results from `Where-Object`
- Affected files: `Invoke-ASRRules.ps1`, `Framework.ps1`, `Test-AdvancedSecurity.ps1`, `Test-DiscoveryProtocolsSecurity.ps1`, `Restore-DNSSettings.ps1`
- Fix: Wrapped results in `@()` to ensure array type

### ✅ Changed

**ASR Prompt Text Improved**
- Changed "untrusted software" to "new software" in ASR prevalence rule prompt
- More neutral language - the software isn't necessarily untrusted, just new/unknown to Microsoft's reputation system

**Code Quality**
- Full codebase review of backup/restore system (2970 lines in `Core/Rollback.ps1`)
- Wireless Display (Miracast) security implementation verified against Microsoft documentation
- All 7 registry policies confirmed correct per MS Policy CSP docs
- Version numbers aligned across all 50+ files

- Fix: Now reads existing rules, updates target, writes complete set back

- Safe check for `$global:NonInteractiveMode` variable

**Registry Backup Protected Keys**
- Enhanced JSON fallback for protected system keys
